Commands for running the app in the local host
1. py -m streamlit run app.py

Pattern for date and time extraction if the given time format is 12 hours
pattern - \d{1,2}\/\d{2,4}\/\d{2,4},\s\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}\s\w{1,2}\s-\s

pattern for 24 hour format
\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4},\s\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s-\s

Problems facing -
1.How to make the website compatible for both 12 and 24 hour format, now only 24 hour format
2.How to extract date and time from 12 hour format
3.Choose the correct algorithm and make it more efficient, now using logistic regression , efficiency is 62%,
  should make the efficiency more than 70%
4.Deploy it to heroku to make it live for everyone to use.
